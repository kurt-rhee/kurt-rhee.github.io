**Figure 2:**  PVLIB

# Introduction

If you are not familiar with Git and Github it might be a daunting task to contritube code to pvlib.  This is a step-by-step guide that should help.  

# Definitions
- Repository:  A storage location for all of the code in a software project

# Github Account

First you need to make an account on Github.  Github is an online code respository that stores software projects in the cloud.  There are many alternatives to Github which is owned by Microsoft, for example Azure Devops, also owned by Microsoft, Atlassian's Bitbucket, Gitlab, Gitea, etc. but most of the open source community has landed on Github as the defacto standard for managing software repositories.

# "Forking" pvlib
Once you have an account on github, you will want to create a fork for the pvlib respository.  A fork is a copy of an existing project with a different main owner.  We will be forking pvlib (owned by the maintainers) in order to create a special version of pvlib owned by us.

1. Go to the pvlib github repository:  https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python
2. Click on this fork button

3. Click on the green "Create fork button"
4. You should now have a forked version of pvlib inside of your own personal github account.

5. Next you are going to want to to "Clone" this fork of pvlib to your local computer.  Copy the https url to your clipboard.

6. I like to use my terminal for this task.  First navigate to the folder where you want your local copy of pvlib to live and then type the following command.
