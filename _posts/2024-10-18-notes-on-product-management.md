# Notes on Product Management

Today is my last day at Terabase Energy as product owner of the PlantPredict performance modeling software tool, and my first day at Proximal Energy as a Sr. Software Engineer.  As I work, I generally take bullet point style notes about the new things that I am learning.  Every once an a while, these bullet point style notes elevate above some arbitrary threshold of what I think might be interesting or useful to my collagues.  Usually these notes have been in the form of small technical snippets about performance modeling or software development.

Looking back at my notes about product management over the past two years, I noticed that there is no way that my notes would fit into a single blog post.  So instead, I made a small booklet and posted it on Github for anybody to download and read.  I hope it is interesting for any of you who might stumble across it.  (There is a download button in the top right area of the screen)
