### Hello, my name is Kurt Rhee.

I am fortunate that thus far, my career has afforded me the opportuntity to work at the intersection between a wide variety of topics including performance modeling,
computational geometry, software development, technical product management and ux integration design.  I have also enjoyed the opportunity to 
expand my curiosity while also making positive impacts on the environment.  This website is both a means of showcasing some of the work
that I have contributed to throughout my career, as well as an archive of interesting problems that I have come across that do not warrant something as formal as an
official publication.  

This website is inspired (in content as well as in aesthetics) by [Mark Mikofski's Blogs](https://mikofski.github.io/) and [Nathan Rooy's Blog](https://nathanrooy.github.io/) which promote an informal sharing of knowledge that to me represents the idealogical best of what the internet has to offer us.

Outside of work, I enjoy surfing, rock climbing and literature.
