### Hello, my name is Kurt Rhee.

![useful image]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/profile.png)

I am fortunate that thus far, my career has afforded me the opportuntity to dive into a wide variety of topics ranging from performance modeling,
computational geometry, software development, technical product management and ux integration design.  I have also njoyed the opportunity to 
expand my curiosity while also making positive impacts on the environment.  This website is both a means of showcasing some of the work
that I have contributed to throughout my career, as well as an archive of interesting problems that I have come across.

Outside of work, I enjoy surfing, rock climbing and literature.
