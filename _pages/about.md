### Hello, my name is Kurt Rhee.

I am currently working as a Performance Engineer for Terabase Energy, specifically on PlantPredict software.
Day to day, this means that I split my time between 4 rather fluid roles: technical product management, performance modeling, software development and ux integration design.

- As a technical product manager, I prioritize and write specs for features or bug fixes that I would like our software development team to work on.
- As a performance engineer I define the models that are used in PlantPredict's solar photovoltaic performance prediction engine, as well as advise Terabase's consulting team on matters regarding solar performance modeling.
- As a software developer, I contribute to PlantPredict's proprietary backend API, its open source SDK and pvlib.
- As a UX integration designer, I attempt to solve the [dual](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem) problem of increasing the capability of PlantPredict while maintaining the tools ease of use.

Outside of work, I enjoy surfing, rock climbing and literature.
