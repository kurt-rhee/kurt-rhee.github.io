### Hello, my name is Kurt Rhee.

I am fortunate that thus far, my career has afforded me the opportuntity to work at the intersection between a wide variety of topics including performance modeling,
computational geometry, software development, technical product management and ux integration design.  I have also enjoyed the opportunity to
expand my curiosity while also making positive impacts on the environment.

This website is inspired (in content as well as in aesthetics) by blogs like [Mark Mikofski's Blogs](https://mikofski.github.io/) and [Nathan Rooy's Blog](https://nathanrooy.github.io/) which promote an informal sharing of knowledge that to me represents the best of what the internet has to offer us.

Outside of work, I enjoy surfing, rock climbing and literature.
